# Product Scraper MERN Application

This is a simple product scraping application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to input a product URL (specifically for Flipkart), scrape product details such as title, description, price, reviews, and purchases, and store the information in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **Frontend (React)**: A form that allows users to input a product URL.
- **Backend (Node.js + Express)**: API to handle product URL submission, scrape product data, and store the data in MongoDB.
- **Scraping Service**: Uses Puppeteer to scrape product details from Flipkart URLs.
- **Retry Logic**: Continuously retries to fetch product data until the product is added due to latency.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Web Scraping**: Puppeteer
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Styling**: CSS

  - `productRoutes.js`: Defines API endpoints for product operations.

- **services**
  - `productService.js`: Contains business logic for adding/rechecking products.
  - `scraperService.js`: Implements Puppeteer to scrape product details from the given URLs.
